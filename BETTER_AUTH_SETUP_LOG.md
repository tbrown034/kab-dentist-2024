# Better Auth Setup Log - Complete Documentation

## Problem You Had
When running `npx @better-auth/cli generate`, you got an error about database connection string.

---

## What Was Fixed (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Installed Required Packages
**What was done:**
```bash
pnpm add kysely-neon kysely
```

**Why this was needed:**
- Neon's serverless driver over HTTP requires a special Kysely dialect
- You were trying to use `Pool` from `@neondatabase/serverless`, but Better Auth's CLI uses Kysely internally
- The `kysely-neon` package provides the bridge between Neon's HTTP driver and Kysely

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Installation Docs: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation (Step 4 - Configure Database, shows various adapters)
- Kysely-Neon GitHub: https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely-neon
  - README states: "kysely-neon offers a Kysely dialect for Neon's serverless driver over HTTP"
  - Shows exact usage: `new NeonDialect({ neon: neon(connectionString) })`

---

### Step 2: Updated auth.ts Configuration
**What was changed:**

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Pool } from "@neondatabase/serverless";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
    },
  },
  database: new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL
  }),
});
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";
import { NeonDialect } from "kysely-neon";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
    },
  },
  database: {
    dialect: new NeonDialect({
      neon: neon(process.env.POSTGRES_URL || process.env.DATABASE_URL || ""),
    }),
    type: "postgres",
  },
});
```

**Why this was needed:**
1. Better Auth expects a Kysely-compatible dialect
2. `Pool` is for WebSocket connections (not HTTP)
3. For Neon's HTTP driver, you need to use `neon()` function with `NeonDialect`
4. The `type: "postgres"` tells Better Auth what kind of database this is

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Docs - Installation: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation
  - Shows drizzle/prisma adapter examples, but the pattern is: `database: { dialect: ..., type: "postgres" }`
- Kysely-Neon README: https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely-neon
  - Shows exact pattern for creating the dialect with `neon()` function

---

### Step 3: Created .env File for CLI
**What was done:**
```bash
grep -E "^(POSTGRES_URL|DATABASE_URL|BETTER_AUTH)" .env.local > .env
```

**Why this was needed:**
- The Better Auth CLI runs in a separate Node process
- Next.js only loads `.env.local` when running the Next.js app
- The CLI looks for `.env` (not `.env.local`) by default
- Without this, `process.env.POSTGRES_URL` was undefined when the CLI tried to import your `auth.ts`

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth CLI Docs: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/cli
  - Doesn't explicitly document this, but it's a common Node.js pattern
  - The CLI uses standard environment variable loading (dotenv behavior)
- Next.js Docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/environment-variables
  - Explains that `.env.local` is for Next.js app, not for external scripts

---

### Step 4: Generated Database Schema
**What was done:**
```bash
npx @better-auth/cli generate
```
Then answered "yes" to create the schema file.

**What this created:**
- A SQL migration file at: `better-auth_migrations/2025-10-01T01-16-22.131Z.sql`
- Contains 4 table definitions: `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`

**Why this was needed:**
- Better Auth needs specific database tables to store user data, sessions, OAuth accounts, and email verification tokens
- The CLI introspects your database and generates the necessary schema

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Installation Docs: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation (Step 5 - Create Database Tables)
  - Says: "Better Auth includes a CLI tool to help manage the schema"
  - Shows two commands: `generate` and `migrate`
  - `generate` creates SQL file, `migrate` applies it (only for Kysely adapter)
- Better Auth CLI Docs: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/cli
  - Details all CLI options and what they do

---

### Step 5: Applied Migration to Neon Database
**What was done:**
Created a temporary script (`run-migration.mjs`) that:
1. Read the generated SQL file
2. Connected to Neon using the `neon()` function
3. Executed each CREATE TABLE statement

**Why this was needed:**
- The `migrate` command only works with Kysely's built-in adapter (not external dialects like kysely-neon)
- Had to manually apply the SQL to the database
- Used Neon's serverless driver to execute the statements

**What tables were created:**
```sql
-- user: stores user accounts (id, name, email, emailVerified, image, timestamps)
-- session: stores active sessions (id, token, expiresAt, ipAddress, userAgent, userId FK)
-- account: stores OAuth provider accounts (id, providerId, userId FK, tokens, passwords)
-- verification: stores email verification codes (id, identifier, value, expiresAt)
```

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Database Docs: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database#core-schema
  - Shows the core schema requirements
- Neon Serverless Driver: https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless
  - Shows how to use `neon()` function and `sql.unsafe()` for dynamic SQL

---

### Step 6: Created API Route Handler
**What was created:**
File: `/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`
```typescript
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";

export const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth);
```

**Why this was needed:**
- Better Auth needs an API endpoint to handle authentication requests
- The catch-all route `[...all]` handles all paths under `/api/auth/*`
- `toNextJsHandler` converts Better Auth's handler to Next.js App Router format

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Installation Docs: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation (Step 8 - Mount Handler)
  - Shows Next.js example with exact code: `export const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth);`
  - States: "This route should handle requests for the path `/api/auth/*`"

---

### Step 7: Created Client-Side Auth Helper
**What was created:**
File: `/lib/auth-client.ts`
```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
});

export const { signIn, signOut, signUp, useSession } = authClient;
```

**Why this was needed:**
- Client-side components need a way to call the auth API
- `createAuthClient` from "better-auth/react" provides React hooks
- Exports common functions for easy imports

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Installation Docs: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation (Step 9 - Create Client Instance)
  - Shows React example: `import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react"`
  - Shows exporting methods: `export const { signIn, signUp, useSession } = createAuthClient()`

## How to Use Better Auth Now

### Sign in with Google:
```tsx
import { signIn } from "@/lib/auth-client";

<button onClick={() => signIn.social({ provider: "google" })}>
  Sign in with Google
</button>
```

### Check if user is logged in:
```tsx
import { useSession } from "@/lib/auth-client";

function MyComponent() {
  const { data: session, isPending } = useSession();

  if (isPending) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (session) return <div>Hello {session.user.name}</div>;
  return <div>Not logged in</div>;
}
```

### Sign out:
```tsx
import { signOut } from "@/lib/auth-client";

<button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign out</button>
```

6. **Neon Serverless Driver**: https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless

---

## Why This Approach Was Needed

The core issue was that Better Auth uses **Kysely** internally for database operations, but you were trying to pass it a **Pool** instance from `@neondatabase/serverless`.

Neon offers two ways to connect:
1. **WebSockets** (using `Pool`) - Works with standard Postgres clients
2. **HTTP** (using `neon()` function) - Serverless-friendly, edge-compatible

For the HTTP approach, you need the `kysely-neon` adapter to bridge Neon's `neon()` function with Kysely's dialect system.

The Better Auth docs show examples with Drizzle and Prisma adapters but don't explicitly show the Neon HTTP dialect pattern - that's why you needed to look at the `kysely-neon` README to understand the correct configuration.

## Admin Route Protection Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-01 01:32 UTC

### Step 8: Protected the `/admin` Route
After completing the basic Better Auth setup, we implemented route protection to restrict access to the admin dashboard to only authenticated users.

#### Files Created:

**1. `/middleware.ts`**
```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Check for Better Auth session cookie
  const sessionCookie = request.cookies.get("better-auth.session_token");

  // If no session cookie and trying to access admin, redirect to login
  if (!sessionCookie && request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/admin")) {
    const loginUrl = new URL("/login", request.url);
    loginUrl.searchParams.set("callbackUrl", request.nextUrl.pathname);
    return NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl);
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/admin/:path*"],
};
```

**Why this was created:**
- Provides fast client-side redirect for unauthenticated users
- Checks for session cookie existence (not validation - that happens on the server)
- Preserves the intended destination URL via `callbackUrl` parameter
- Only runs for `/admin` routes (configured in matcher)

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Next.js Integration: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/next
  - Shows middleware pattern with session cookie check
  - **Important warning:** "Relying solely on middleware for security is dangerous" - always validate on server

---

**2. `/app/login/page.tsx`**
```typescript
"use client";

import { signIn } from "@/lib/auth-client";
import { useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function LoginPage() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const callbackUrl = searchParams.get("callbackUrl") || "/admin";
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleGoogleSignIn = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      await signIn.social({
        provider: "google",
        callbackURL: callbackUrl,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Sign in error:", error);
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    // ... Google sign-in button UI
  );
}
```

**Why this was created:**
- Provides a dedicated login page for authentication
- Uses `signIn.social()` from Better Auth client to initiate Google OAuth
- Reads `callbackUrl` from query params to redirect after successful login
- Shows loading state during OAuth flow

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Google OAuth: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google
  - Shows `signIn.social({ provider: "google" })` pattern
  - Documents `callbackURL` parameter for post-auth redirect

---

**3. `/app/(routes)/admin/_components/AdminDashboard.tsx`**
- Extracted all dashboard UI code from `page.jsx` into a separate client component
- Allows the parent page to be a server component for session validation
- Contains all the charts, metrics, and data visualization

---

**4. `/app/(routes)/admin/page.tsx` (Replaced `page.jsx`)**
```typescript
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import AdminDashboard from "./_components/AdminDashboard";

export default async function AdminPage() {
  const session = await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: await headers(),
  });

  if (!session) {
    redirect("/login?callbackUrl=/admin");
  }

  return <AdminDashboard />;
}
```

**Why this was created:**
- Server component that validates session on every request
- Uses `auth.api.getSession()` to get full session object (not just cookie check)
- This is the **actual security layer** - validates session on server
- If no valid session, redirects to login page
- Only renders dashboard if session is valid

**Documentation source:**
- Better Auth Next.js Integration: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/next
  - Shows server-side session validation pattern
  - `auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })`
  - Recommends this approach over middleware-only protection

---

### How the Protection Works (Two-Layer Security)

**Layer 1: Middleware (Fast Redirect)**
1. User visits `/admin` without being logged in
2. Middleware checks for `better-auth.session_token` cookie
3. If not found, immediately redirects to `/login?callbackUrl=/admin`
4. This happens before the page even loads (fast UX)

**Layer 2: Server Component (Actual Security)**
1. If middleware allows through (cookie exists), page component loads
2. Server component calls `auth.api.getSession()` to validate the session
3. This hits the database and verifies the session token is valid
4. If invalid/expired, redirects to login
5. If valid, renders the dashboard

**Why both layers:**
- Middleware = Fast UX (instant redirect for obvious cases)
- Server validation = Real security (validates token isn't forged/expired)

---

### Testing Results

**Test 1: Unauthenticated Access**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/admin
# Result: HTTP 307 redirect to /login?callbackUrl=%2Fadmin
```
✅ **SUCCESS** - Middleware correctly redirected unauthenticated user

**Test 2: Login Page Loads**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/login
# Expected: HTML page with Google sign-in button
```
⚠️ **NOTE** - Login page attempted to load but encountered unrelated errors with existing layout imports (not auth-related)

**Test 3: Manual Browser Test**
- Opened `http://localhost:3000/admin` in browser
- Expected behavior:
  1. Middleware redirects to `/login?callbackUrl=/admin`
  2. Login page shows Google sign-in button
  3. Click button → Google OAuth flow
  4. After Google auth → Better Auth creates session
  5. Redirects back to `/admin`
  6. Page component validates session
  7. Dashboard renders

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Middleware redirect working (307 to login)
- ✅ API routes exist (`/api/auth/*`)
- ✅ Database tables created and ready
- ⚠️ Login page has build errors due to unrelated missing imports in `app/layout.js`
- 🔜 Need to fix layout imports to complete end-to-end test

---

### What You Need to Do Next

**To test the full flow:**
1. Fix the import errors in `/app/layout.js` (unrelated to auth)
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin`
3. You should be redirected to login page
4. Click "Sign in with Google"
5. Complete Google OAuth
6. You'll be redirected back to admin dashboard
7. Dashboard will show because you're authenticated

**To add more users:**
- Any user who signs in with Google will be added to the database
- You can add role-based access control later if needed

**To sign out:**
- Add a sign-out button using `signOut()` from `@/lib/auth-client`

---

### Summary of Protection Implementation

**Files created/modified:**
1. ✅ `/middleware.ts` - Cookie-based redirect
2. ✅ `/app/login/page.tsx` - Google OAuth login UI
3. ✅ `/app/(routes)/admin/page.tsx` - Server-side session validation
4. ✅ `/app/(routes)/admin/_components/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Dashboard UI component

**Security layers:**
